# AdaptiveBuffers
Simplify Serialization and Deserialization Code Generation in C++

## Introduction
AdaptiveBuffers is a powerful tool designed to tackle the challenges of working with byte-structured messages in your projects. Imagine dealing with device communication where messages are described in Excel sheets, but no serialization or deserialization methods exist. Decoding each message manually becomes a time-consuming task. AdaptiveBuffers automates this process, generating serialization and deserialization methods from your defined message format, making your life as a developer much easier.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind creating AdaptiveBuffers came from the frustration of handling byte-structured messages without the corresponding code support. If you find yourself in a similar situation, where data formats are specified in documentation but lack structured code, this tool is here to help.

## For Whom is This
If you're starting a new project, you might not need AdaptiveBuffers. However, if you're working with data specified in documentation but not structured in code, this tool can be your savior. It simplifies the process of generating serialization and deserialization methods, ensuring smoother communication with byte-structured data.
